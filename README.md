# Monash Haulers Database Design Case Study 
## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a conceptual database model for Monash Haulers, a trucking business that provides trucks and trailers for transportation services. The project was part of the FIT2094 Databases unit at Monash University, showcasing database design skills crucial for a data analyst role.

The objective was to transform a case study into a full conceptual database model, focusing on applying relational database theories, creating an optimised design, and adhering to industry standards.
## Key Deliverables
1. **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
- Created a full conceptual model using crow’s foot notation.
- Identified key entities, attributes, and relationships based on the provided case study.
- Accurately defined cardinalities and connectivity between entities.
2. **Attributes and Relationships**
- Assigned attributes to entities in alignment with the business requirements.
- Modeled relationships with minimum and maximum cardinality for all entities.
3. **Industry Standards**
- Maintained consistency in notation and adhered to best practices for ERD design.
- Avoided unnecessary entities, attributes, and relationships to ensure an optimized model.
## Technologies Used
- **LucidChart**: For creating the ERD with crow’s foot notation.
- **Microsoft Teams**: For team collaboration and documentation.
- **FIT GitLab**: For version control and development history tracking.
## Learning Outcomes:
- Applied theoretical knowledge of relational databases to a practical case study.
- Developed expertise in database modeling and conceptual design.
- Strengthened teamwork, communication, and project management skills.

**Conclusion** This project highlights my ability to analyze complex business requirements and translate them into efficient, industry-standard database designs. By completing this assignment, I gained valuable hands-on experience with conceptual database modeling, teamwork, and leveraging collaboration tools for effective project management.
