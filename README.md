# Monash Haulers Database Design Case Study 
## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of designing and implementing a relational database for Monash Haulers, a trucking business that provides trucks and trailers for transportation services. The project was part of the FIT2094 Databases unit at Monash University, showcasing database design skills crucial for a data analyst role. It demonstrates the application of database design principles, normalization, and implementation skills using Oracle RDBMS. 

The objective was to transform a case study into a full database model, focusing on applying relational database theories, creating an optimised design, and adhering to industry standards.
## Key Deliverables
1. **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
- Created a full conceptual model using crow’s foot notation.
- Identified key entities, attributes, and relationships based on the provided case study.
- Accurately defined cardinalities and connectivity between entities.
- Maintained consistency in notation and adhered to best practices for ERD design.
2. **Attributes and Relationships**
- Assigned attributes to entities in alignment with the business requirements.
- Modeled relationships with minimum and maximum cardinality for all entities.
3. **Normalisation**
- Performed data normalization to Third Normal Form (3NF), ensuring data integrity and eliminating redundancy.
- Clearly documented normalisation steps, including identification of partial and transitive dependencies.
4. **Logical Database Design**
- Created a logical data model in Oracle Data Modeler based on the normalized conceptual model.
- Included surrogate keys, constraints, and comments for enhanced clarity and usability.
5. **Schema Development and Implementation**
- Generated SQL scripts to create the database schema, incorporating business rules through constraints and checks.
- Tested the schema in Oracle RDBMS to ensure proper functionality and adherence to requirements.
## Technologies Used
- **Oracle SQL Developer**: Used for database modeling and schema testing.
- **LucidChart**: For creating the ERD with crow’s foot notation and the conceptual data model.
- **Microsoft Teams**: For team collaboration and documentation.
- **FIT GitLab**: For version control and development history tracking.

**Conclusion** This project enhanced my understanding of relational database theory, logical database design, and SQL implementation. It also strengthened my ability to work collaboratively in a team environment and communicate technical solutions effectively.
